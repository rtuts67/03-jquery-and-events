#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Maithrika and Rosie paired together. It took about 3 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we added the script tag for the new JS file to index.html.
  2. Next, we hid all articles under author-filter and set a fade-in for the articles written by the chosen author.
  3. Then, we did basically the same thing for the category-filter.
  4. Then, we hid all the tab-content sections when a tab was clicked on the main nav, and faded in the relevant tab-content section. This was the hardest one for us.
  5. Lastly, we wrote code to handle the click on the "Read on" links. We made sure the page didn't refresh, and then expanded the article-body. For the stretch goal, we created another (initially display: none) link that said "Show less", and used the event handler to toggle display for both, as well as toggling between the expanded and collapsed version of article-body. We then modified this to only happen for the article clicked.
